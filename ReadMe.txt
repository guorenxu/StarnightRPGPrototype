This is Starnight, an isometric game prototype written in C++ and DirectX 9 during my junior year in high school. At the time, I played a few good isometric games like Dark Ages and I decided to make something similar.

Features:
Draggable smoothly transitioning UI (made without any other API)
Unit-based 4 directional movement
Basic combat with monster, monster respawning
Health bars

**Instructions For Play**
To run the program, please double click the "Starnight.exe" file inside the "Isometric 2D Program" directory.
You will need to have DirectX runtime installed on your computer.
To Quit : Press Escape
To move your squid around : Arrow Keys
